# PZ PIZZA SALES RECORD ANALYSIS 2025
In this project, I aim to analyse the 2025 PZ Pizza Sales Records to gain insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and operational trends. By examining key metrics such as total revenue, order volume, popular pizza types, sizes, and sales patterns over time, the analysis aims to identify factors driving demand and profitability. The findings from this study are intended to support data-driven decision-making, improve inventory planning, optimise pricing strategies, and enhance overall business performance within the pizza sales operation.
The issue of insufficient data was a challenge in the analysis, as such, limited data comparison for easy analysis.
Data Source: Kaggle, youtube

# Project Split:

# Story of Data:
This data describes the sales record of pizza by a shop over a period of time, displaying the unit price, total price and details of the different types of pizza sold in the restaurant. The data also gives details of order time and date, which would help us in finding the sales trend for the period under review, and this was analysed with the use of Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, SQL (PostgreSQL) for data manipulation like calculation, PowerBI for data visualisations.
